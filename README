This project represents an attempt to create an alternative to
emacs' find-alternate-file that allows one to undo changes introduced
by said function. Other alternatives may exist, but I haven't found
them.

Installation
============

Put this file in your load path and put:

  (require 'open-alternate-to-kill-ring)

This makes the funtion available. At this point you can re-bind
C-x, C-v to call "open-alternative-to-kill-ring" by putting

  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-v") 'open-alternate-to-kill-ring)

into your init file.

TODO: this is temporary functionality. Ideally, changes introduced
by C-x, C-v should be able to be undone by a simple C-/
